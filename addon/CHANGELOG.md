#### 🚨 Breaking Changes

- The timings and class names have changed to conform vue's transitions. The main advantage is the
  excellent interoperability with popular css libraries like TailwindCSS or Animate.css.
  Here is a before and after example of a style were were using on the docs.

Before:

```css
.example-enter {
  opacity: 0;
}

.example-enter.example-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in;
}
.example-leave {
  opacity: 1;
}

.example-leave.example-leave-active {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in;
}
```

After:

```css
/* initial state */
.example-enter,
.example-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
}

/* final state */
.example-enter-to,
.example-leave {
  opacity: 1;
}

/* easings */
.example-enter-active,
.example-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in;
}
```

# Ember CSS Transitions [![Build Status](https://github.com/peec/ember-css-transitions/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/peec/ember-css-transitions/actions?query=workflow%3ACI) [![Ember Observer Score](https://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-css-transitions.svg)](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-css-transitions)

This addon provides a nice way of defining CSS Transitions for Ember Components. Which means, only css based animations for performance - and no animation library needed.

Ember CSS Transitions is heavily inspired (and CSS compatible) with [Vue's CSS Transitions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html).

Animations are completely based on CSS classes.

## Documentation

- [https://peec.github.io/ember-css-transitions/](https://peec.github.io/ember-css-transitions/)

## How it works

Ultimately you define your animations and transitions with only css like:

```css
/* initial state */
.example-enter,
.example-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
}

/* final state */
.example-enter-to,
.example-leave {
  opacity: 1;
}

/* easings */
.example-enter-active,
.example-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in;
}
```

And using the included modifier like:

```hbs
<div {{css-transition "example"}}>
  <h1>Hello world</h1>
</div>
```

or by manually specifying classes, perfect for libraries like [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

```hbs
{{!-- Using Tailwind CSS provided classes --}}
<div {{css-transition
  enterClass="opacity-0"
  enterActiveClass="transition-opacity duration-500 ease-in-out"
  enterToClass="opacity-100"
  leaveClass="opacity-100"
  leaveActiveClass="transition-opacity duration-500 ease-in-out"
  leaveToClass="opacity-0"}}>
  <h1>Hello world</h1>
</div>
```

If you are using [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com) then you will see transition instructions included in the code, as in this example:

```hbs
<!--
  Slide-over panel, show/hide based on slide-over state.

  Entering: "transform transition ease-in-out duration-500 sm:duration-700"
    From: "translate-x-full"
    To: "translate-x-0"
  Leaving: "transform transition ease-in-out duration-500 sm:duration-700"
    From: "translate-x-0"
    To: "translate-x-full"
-->
```

You should map these instructions to this addon's API in the following way:

| TailwindUI | Addon            |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Entering   | enterActiveClass |
| From       | enterClass       |
| To         | enterToClass     |
| Leaving    | leaveActiveClass |
| From       | leaveClass       |
| To         | leaveToClass     |
